# frist_recommendation_engine
We have created a first recommendation engine based on the Amazon review data of 2018 for Toys and Games.
We leveraged the power of the **surprise library for Python**, to create this first recommendation engine. Through it, customers looking to buy toys and games for children or for themselves, would be able to get recommendations on what to buy next.
